# Spotify Streams Analysis

## We created a logistic regression model to predict the success of a song based on various metrics, such as danceability, liveliness, energy, etc. A song was considered a success if it received more than the average streams, which we calculated from our dataset. A success was denoted with a "1", otherwise it received a "0". This metric was saved into a new column "song_success".
